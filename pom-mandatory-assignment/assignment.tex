%Identify the stakeholders in your project and describe their interests in the project andhow you will handle them
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[h]{|c|p{25em}|}
		\hline
		Stakeholder & Interest \\ \hline
		General Practitioners & They are our target demographic as they use the service to provide better healthcare to their clients. Developing our program will be able to increase the confidence of their diagnoses. \\ \hline
		Developers & They are interested in it because their business and thereby wages depends on it, delivering a good product could gain them good advantages when it comes to income and or future job prospects. \\ \hline
		Healthcare companies & The companies that hires the General Practitioners are the one who will most likely be paying for our service, their interested is whether this will earn them more revenue either in the long run or short term.\\ \hline

%Create a WBS for your project and document it as a table
In this project, the group are using a Top-Down estimation process because of the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It's the first time the group develops a project for healthcare and thereby don't know completely what is involved yet.
	\item It's a small project and the group only have two developers, the scope of the project is small.
	\item There is no contract involved.
	\item There is no current customer, only general practitioners who have offered to guide and therefore no details are needed for the customers.
\end{itemize}
